For front-end, I’ve primarily worked with React Native for constructing mobile apps, and now am exploring native development for iOS and Android. For back-end, I’ve worked on Java micro services during internships and have developed my own back-ends with AWS + MongoDB, including user auth, REST APIs, and data and asset storage. I’ve also worked in an assortment of other fields, from supervised learning and neural networks for machine learning projects, to UI/UX designing of logos, glyphs, marketing material with Sketch.",
