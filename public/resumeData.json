For front-end, I’ve primarily worked with React Native for constructing mobile apps, and now am exploring native development for iOS and Android. For back-end, I’ve worked on Java micro services during internships and have developed my own back-ends with AWS + MongoDB, including user auth, REST APIs, and data and asset storage. I’ve also worked in an assortment of other fields, from supervised learning and neural networks for machine learning projects, to UI/UX designing of logos, glyphs, marketing material with Sketch.",

With more and more countries legalizing marijuana, consumers want a simple and intuitive experience to finding cannabis perfect for them, both for recreational and medical purposes. Joyleaf is that experience.\nJoyleaf is a strain finder app on iOS and Android that lets you discover over 2,000 unique marijuana strains from around the world so you can find cannabis perfect for you.\nI led a team of three other developers, who primarily worked on front-end development and algorithm design for our REST API.\nI used Xamarin Forms, a .NET cross-platform UI framework, to deliver a smooth, native, front-end experience for both iOS and Android, with a C#-shared codebase to boost development workflow.\nI developed the back-end with Firebase in order to authenticate users, store app data, and host a REST API.\nI also used Sketch and Photoshop to design all the visual components, including the app icon, splash screens, promotional media, and all the glyphs in the app."
